## Web API Demo

This repository contains sample code, PowerPoint, and documentation for my ASP.NET Web API presentation. It includes the before and after code.

### Presentation Abstract

Modern web applications have seen an explosion in Web API creation. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Azure, you name it - it is becoming essential to provide a Web API so that consumers can build applications and mashups on top of your services. Web 2.0 has shown a trend away from SOAP towards a REST architecture style. With the new ASP.NET Web API, Microsoft is now providing first-class support for HTTP services including tools to apply the richness of a REST architectural style. This demo heavy presentation will show how the new ASP.NET Web API will enable you to build rich HTTP services in a REST architectural style while leveraging custom media types, custom HTTP handlers, jQuery and more! The presentation will also cover new features of MVC 4 including Razor enhancements, support for mobile apps, and single page applications.
